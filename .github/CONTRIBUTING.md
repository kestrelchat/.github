# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This document outlines the expectations and workflow for contributing to this repository.

## Repository Lifecycle

* Prefer to use the [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification for commit messages and PR titles.
* Sign your commits where possible. See GitHub’s documentation on [commit signature verification](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits).
* Sign-off your commits using the Git `--signoff` flag. Read more about Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) obligations at [https://developercertificate.org/](https://developercertificate.org/).

  > Note: Commit signing (GPG/SSH) and commit sign-off (`Signed-off-by`) are separate. Sign-off is expected where possible; commit signing is strongly encouraged.
* If a formatter is present, use it (e.g. `prettier`, `cargo fmt`).
* Keep each pull request focused on a single feature or change. Multiple closely related bug fixes may be acceptable.

## Development Setup

* Use the project’s specified toolchain, language version, and dependencies where applicable.
* Follow the existing project structure and patterns.
* Avoid unrelated refactors or stylistic changes in the same PR.

## Testing

* Automated tests are not currently set up.
* When tests are introduced in the future, contributors will be expected to add or update tests for new behavior and ensure all tests pass before submitting a PR.

## Pull Requests

* PR titles **must** follow the [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format.
* Clearly describe what changed and why.
* Link related issues in the PR description when applicable.
* Large changes (major refactors, dependency changes, or architectural shifts) should be discussed before implementation.

## Merging Pull Requests

* Pull requests are squash merged.
* The PR title will be used as the final commit message, so ensure it is accurate and well-formed.

## Conduct

* Be respectful and constructive in discussions, reviews, and feedback.
